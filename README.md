Overview
This project is part of an ongoing research paper focusing on the use of spike data from sensors and its application in machine learning. The primary focus is on classification and prediction using different ML algorithms. The repository includes:

Raw sensor data
Pre-processing scripts
Machine learning models (classification and prediction)
Results and figures
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of spike data collected from various sensors. The data is stored in CSV format, with each row representing a sample and each column representing sensor readings or derived features.

Key files:

spike_data.csv: Raw sensor spike data.
preprocessed_data.csv: Processed data used for training and testing.
Machine Learning Models
We apply a range of machine learning algorithms to the preprocessed data, including:

Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Logistic Regression (LR)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree (DT)
Ensemble Methods (ENS)
Results
The results include classification accuracy, prediction times, and a comparison of model performance. Visualizations and figures related to these outcomes are included in the /figures folder. These results are detailed in the accompanying research paper.
